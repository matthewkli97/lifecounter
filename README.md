# lifecounter


- [x] When I launch the application, it should show me four “players”. 
- [x] Each “player” should have a label for their life total, and four push buttons (“+”, “-“,”+5”,”-5”).
- [x] When I push the “+” pushbutton for player 1, it should increment player 1’s life total by 1.
- [x] “-“ should reduce the life total by 1
- [x] “+5” should increment by 5
- [x] “-5” should decrement by 5
- [x] When a player's life total drops to 0 or less, it should display a label at the bottom of the app saying "Player X LOSES!"
- [x] When I rotate the device (landscape to portrait mode or vice versa), it should resize itself evenly.
- [x] When I run the app on different devices, it should seem "equally balanced" on each device, regardless of orientation. Players' life total labels should be proportional, buttons proportional, and so on.
